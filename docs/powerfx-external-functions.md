# Power Fx functions requiring external implementation

This document helps implementation planning by combining **why a function is external** with **what it does** and a **quick usage example**. Descriptions are pulled from `PowerFxResources.en-US.resx` when available; otherwise they are concise host-oriented summaries.

## Classification

- **Recognized by binder but not implemented in core library**: listed in `OtherKnownFunctions`.
- **Runtime-injected in interpreter**: added through interpreter config extension methods.
- **Non-self-contained in core metadata**: function implementation exists but is marked `IsSelfContained => false`.
